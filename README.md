## 🧩 System Workflow

1. User logs in (Doctor/Patient)
2. Joins consultation via Meeting ID
3. Starts voice/text conversation
4. Speech → Text conversion (if voice)
5. Real-time translation (if different languages)
6. Conversation stored in database
7. NLP extracts symptoms
8. ML model predicts disease
9. Summary generated with diagnosis
